The previous AI engineer was tasked with enhancing a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application by integrating Three.js animations for a visually appealing website. The engineer began by understanding the existing codebase, identifying  and  as key frontend components, and  for styling. User preferences were explicitly gathered, guiding the animation style to be subtle, lightweight, and interactive.

The core of the work involved creating and integrating new Three.js components (, , , ) into the  and  files. The engineer also focused on removing descriptive floating text and implementing a  effect. However, multiple JSX parsing errors arose during the integration of  in , leading to syntax issues. Despite attempts to fix these errors, the application currently displays a white screen, indicating an unresolved frontend rendering issue, which the engineer was actively debugging by inspecting  when the session ended.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to beautify the application's website using Three.js animations. Specific requirements include:
-   **Overall Animation:** Implement Three.js animations across the entire website, making it visually appealing.
-   **Logo Animation:** On the home page, the logo should spin automatically every 7 seconds. The user later clarified that the logo should auto-spin only on page load, then require user interaction.
-   **Custom Elements:** Add custom Three.js elements to enhance the aesthetic.
-   **Text Removal:** Remove any explicit written elements describing animations (e.g., floating).
-   **Welcome to AYDC Enhancement:** Apply Three.js features to the Welcome to AYDC text on the home page for a beautiful effect.
-   **Animation Style (User Preference):** Animations should be subtle and lightweight, suitable for all devices. This includes floating particles/geometric shapes in the background (lightweight) and 3D elements that respond to mouse interaction.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Three.js:** JavaScript 3D library for rendering animated 3D graphics on a web browser.
-   **React:** Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
-   **FastAPI:** Python web framework for building the backend API.
-   **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for data storage.
-   **JSX:** Syntax extension for JavaScript, used in React for describing UI.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


**Detailed Directory Structure (Frontend Focus for this task):**


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Defines project metadata and dependencies for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Not explicitly shown as modified, but would be updated when new packages (like Three.js or related libraries) are installed. It was viewed to understand existing setup.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Represents the main home page of the application, rendering key content and features.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to integrate , , , and to apply a  effect to feature cards, blog post cards, and executive member cards. Descriptive floating text was removed. Multiple syntax errors related to  integration were encountered and fixed.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Defines the overall page structure, including headers, footers, and global elements.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include the  for site-wide background effects and to enhance the header logo with 3D elements using .

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains global CSS styles for the application, including Tailwind CSS imports and custom styles.
    -   **Changes**: Explored by the AI engineer to understand existing styling, no explicit modifications shown in the trajectory.

-   ** (New)**:
    -   **Summary**: A newly created component intended to render subtle, lightweight floating particles or geometric shapes in the background across the website.
    -   **Changes**: Created.

-   ** (New/Modified)**:
    -   **Summary**: A component for handling the spinning animation of the logo, likely using Three.js.
    -   **Changes**: Created/Modified to implement the logo spinning animation logic as per user request.

-   ** (New)**:
    -   **Summary**: A new component designed to apply Three.js features to text elements, specifically for the Welcome to AYDC text.
    -   **Changes**: Created.

-   ** (New)**:
    -   **Summary**: A new component created to manage mouse-responsive 3D elements and enhance the header logo.
    -   **Changes**: Created.

-   ** (Implied Component)**:
    -   **Summary**: Although not explicitly listed as created, this component's usage was introduced in  to provide 3D hover effects on various cards. Its integration led to several JSX parsing errors.
    -   **Changes**: Its application logic was integrated into , causing and then necessitating fixes for syntax errors.

<pending_tasks>
-   The current work is ongoing debugging to resolve the white screen error on the frontend.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging a critical frontend rendering issue, specifically a white screen, which appeared after integrating various Three.js components and applying the  effect within the  component. Several JSX parsing errors, identified by ESLint (e.g., Unexpected token ), occurred during these modifications in  (at lines 173, 224, and 270), which the engineer attempted to fix.

Console logs from  confirmed a JSX parsing error. The engineer's last action was to re-examine the  file in its entirety to identify any remaining or overlooked JSX structural issues that could be causing the white screen. The root cause appears to be incorrect JSX syntax or structure introduced during the integration of the  component.
